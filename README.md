# challenge-cripto-react-native

Our React-native coding challenge is a simple "Crypto Tracker". Users should be able to add new cryptocurrencies, visualize the current price and the change in price in % for the last 24 hours, and also be able to remove a cryptocurrency from the "Crypto Tracker". 

```
Important: Please make sure you use ReactNative (not Expo), Redux Thunk, Hooks, and TypeScript.
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running...
```

# Suggested design and assets:

You can find bellow a design mockup for the challenge. The app should stick as closely as possible to this one:
